# Python Kanban Board

A simple Kanban board project written in Python.  

## 📚 Goal
Build a task management system step by step.

## 🗂 Roadmap

### Phase 1 ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Initial setup with a `main()` function that prints a welcome message
- [x] Add `Task` class with id, title, and description
- [x] Add `Column` class with add and remove task methods
- [x] Create `Board` class to manage multiple columns and display tasks across the board

### Phase 2 ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Add ability to move tasks between columns
- [x] Improve board display to show task IDs and descriptions
- [x] Add simple user input (example: choose column, add/remove tasks interactively)

### Phase 3 ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Save/load board state from a file (perhaps JSON or SQL)
- [x] Add command‑line interface or GUI

### 🎯 Future Ideas
- [ ] Expand with features like deadlines, priorities, or tags
- [ ] Search/filter tasks by keyword, tag, or priority
- [ ] Edit existing tasks (update title/description)
- [ ] Archive completed tasks for history
- [ ] Notifications/reminders for deadlines
- [ ] Export board to Markdown/HTML
- [ ] Multi‑user support for collaboration (I hope again)
