# Python Kanban Board

A simple Kanban board project written in Python.  

## 📚 Goal
Build a task management system step by step.

## 🗂 Roadmap

### Phase 1 ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Initial setup with a `main()` function that prints a welcome message
- [x] Add `Task` class with id, title, and description
- [x] Add `Column` class with add and remove task methods
- [x] Create `Board` class to manage multiple columns and display tasks across the board

### Phase 2 🚧 (Next)
- [ ] Add ability to move tasks between columns
- [ ] Improve board display to show task IDs and descriptions
- [ ] Add simple user input (example: choose column, add/remove tasks interactively)

### Phase 3 🎯 (Future Ideas)
- [ ] Save/load board state from a file (perhaps JSON or SQL)
- [ ] Add command‑line interface or GUI
- [ ] Expand with features like deadlines, priorities, or tags (I hope)
